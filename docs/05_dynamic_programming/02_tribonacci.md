# tribonacci

## Description

Write a function tribonacci that takes in a number argument, n, and returns the n-th number of the Tribonacci sequence.

The 0-th and 1-st numbers of the sequence are both 0.

The 2-nd number of the sequence is 1.

To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous three numbers.

Solve this recursively.
