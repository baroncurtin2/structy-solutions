# fib

## Description

Write a function fib that takes in a number argument, n, and returns the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The 0-th number of the sequence is 0.

The 1-st number of the sequence is 1.

To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous two numbers.

Solve this recursively.
